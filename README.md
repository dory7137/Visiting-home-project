# Go-home-project
The aim of this project is to compare the statistics of the COVID-19 virus data in Ireland and Hungary. 
In addition to comparing the data, a further aim of the project is to try to predict how the virus infection will be in the two countries based on the previous data. 
The ultimate goal is to use this prediction to calculate when both countries will be on the green list (based on EU regulations), 
so when the daily number of cases will be so low that anybody can travel normally between the two country without any further costs. 
Or in other words: when would it be worth buying a plane ticket to visit our family.  

For this I used the "JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data" url: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

STEPS: 

1. Load and edit the data for the analysis.
2. Visualize these informations using matplotlib pyplot
3. With a SIR model, try to predict the future numbers
4. Used this prediction to calculate the "Green list" point for both country
